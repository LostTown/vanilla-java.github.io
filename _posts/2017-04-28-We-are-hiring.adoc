== About us

Most people know of Chronicle by our first open source project called Chronicle Queue,  We have since developed a number of other open-source projects such as Chronicle-Map, Chronicle-Engine and our latest commercial offering Chronicle-Fix. All these projects have a few things in common, they all focus on getting C like performance from java, they all use off-heap storage to provide very fast interprocess communication between processes on the same computer.  

Most of our clients are investment banks in London and New York.
