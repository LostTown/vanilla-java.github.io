= Microservices in the Chronicle worlds - Part 2

In Part 1, we looked at how we can easily create and test components which expect asynchronous messages in and produce asynchronous messages out.  However, how do we turn this into a service?

=== Turning our components into a service.

The key thing which is missing from our components is a transport.  A lack of a transport simplifies testing, profiling and debugging, but we need to distribute our components, and for this we need a transport.

The is a wide range of possible transports available

* Raw TCP messages or UDP packets
* JMS Messaging
* REST API
* Database tables
* Files dropped into a directory.
* a thread safe Queue
* shared memory
* http://chronicle.software/products/chronicle-queue/[Chronicle Queue]
* no transport at all (method calls are fine for a given use case)

It is the Chronicle Queue we will be looking at in the post.
