= Reviewing Exception Handling
Peter Lawrey
:hp-tags: Exceptions

When developing an application it can be hard enough to get the happy path of an application working, let alone worry about what might happen when something goes wrong.

I have asked a number of developers recently what they do when they get an exception and usually they log it or pass it back to the user.

However, are there alternatives and what ways can to pass it the exception on?

== Handling the Exception

=== Catch an Exception to fall back.

When a specific Exception occurs you can fall back to a default result.

.Simple fallback
[source, Java]
----
private static String getHostName0() {
    try {
        return InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();
    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
        return "localhost";
    }
}
----


This method looks for a field in a class. If this fails it looks for a field in it's super class. This fall back behaviour requires that the appropriate exception is caught.

NOTE: The discard exception is added to the original with `addSuppressed`.  Whether this is a good idea, depends on each case.

.Fallback on a specific exception
[source, Java]
----
/**
 * Get the Field for a class by name.
 *
 * @param clazz to get the field for
 * @param name  of the field
 * @return the Field.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if no field with that name could be found.
 */
public static Field getField(Class clazz, String name) throws IllegalArgumentException {
     try {
         Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(name);
         field.setAccessible(true);
         return field;

     } catch (NoSuchFieldException e) {
         Class superclass = clazz.getSuperclass();
         if (superclass != null)
             try {
                 return getField(superclass, name);
             } catch (Exception e2) {
                 e.addSuppressed(e2);
             }
         throw new IllegalArgumentException(clazz + " does not have a public field " + name, e);
     }
 }
----

=== Signal for special handling.

Special handling may be a delibrate exception to say this component is no longer valid and shouldn't be used again.

.Catch an Exception in a nested call and remove a subscriber which is no longer valid.
[source, Java]
----
try {
 for (int i = 0; i < kvStore.segments(); i++)
     kvStore.entriesFor(i, e -> subscriber.onMessage(e.getKey(), e.getValue()));

} catch (InvalidSubscriberException dontAdd) {
 topicSubscribers.remove(subscriber);
}
----

NOTE: The checked exception is thrown inside a lambda which expects this specific exception.

=== Wrap an Exception with AssertionError

In this case, the Field returned by getField shouldn't ever throw an IllegalAccessException, so it has been wrapped with an AssertionError.

It only make sense to wrap an Exception with an AssertionError when you know this is something which should never happen (not something you hope will never happen)

.Exception is not possible
[source, Java]
----
/**
 * get a the value of a field by name.
 * <p>
 * If the name has a path with a / it is split into names and navigated into the object. e.g. "a/b" will look for a field "b" in the object in field "a"
 * <p>
 * If any reference in the path is null, the return is null.
 *
 * @param obj  Object to extract the value from
 * @param name path to the field.
 * @return the value of the field as an object if found, or null if any field in the path was null.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the field could not be found.
 */
public static <V> V getValue(Object obj, String name) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    for (String n : name.split("/")) {
        Field f = getField(obj.getClass(), n);
        try {
            obj = f.get(obj);
            if (obj == null)
                return null;
        } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
            throw new AssertionError(e);
        }
    }
    return (V) obj;
}
----

=== Set the interrupted flag if caught

When a thread is interrupted, it should remain so until the overall task is

[source, Java]
----
/**
 * Silently pause for milli seconds.
 *
 * @param millis to sleep for.
 */
public static void pause(long millis) {
    long timeNanos = millis * 1000000;
    if (timeNanos > 10e6) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(millis);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupted();
        }
    } else {
        LockSupport.parkNanos(timeNanos);
    }
}
----

==== Additional printing for debugging only.

Sometimes an error which would be too "noisy" for production code might be useful in trying to trace a bug in the code.

In this case, we check whether the code is running in the debugger and log an exception we normally expect to handle queiter or silently.

.Additional logging when attempting to reconnect to a TCP server.
[source, Java]
----
if (Jvm.isDebug())
    e.printStackTrace();
----

==== Adding the Exception to the result.

In a method which does a best attempt at decoding some binary data, and the caller wants to see as much as could be decoded, even if an exception occurred.

.Add the Exception to the StringWriter.
[source, Java]
----
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace(new PrintWriter(writer));
----

=== Capturing a Throwable thrown in a plain thread in a unit test.

Sometimes you just want to use a plain thread.  However, you still need an exception thrown in that thread to cause the test to fail.

[source, Java]
----
Throwable[] thrown = { null };

Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        // something
    } catch (Throwable e) {
        thrown[0] = e;
    }
});
t.start();

// check something.

t.join();

if (thrown[0] != null)
    throw thrown[0];
----

==== Rethrow as an unchecked exception.

In this case, rather than wrap the checked exception as an unchecked one, the Exception can be blindly re-thrown as the original exception

This is useful when a checked exception is thrown inside a lambda which doesn't expect a checked exception.

[source, Java]
----
public List<String> collectFiles(List<String> filenames) throws IOException {
    return filenames.stream()
            .flatMap(f -> {
                try {
                    return Files.lines(Paths.get(f));
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw Jvm.rethrow(e);
                }
            })
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
----

Where Jvm.rethrow is implement as follows

[source, Java]
----
/**
 * Cast a CheckedException as an unchecked one.
 *
 * @param throwable to cast
 * @param <T>       the type of the Throwable
 * @return this method will never return a Throwable instance, it will just throw it.
 * @throws T the throwable as an unchecked throwable
 */
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public static <T extends Throwable> RuntimeException rethrow(Throwable throwable) throws T {
    throw (T) throwable; // rely on vacuous cast
}
----

However, this is really a hack to get around the fact that the `Function` used, doesn't support a checked exception.
A better solution, if you can chose the type of lambda is to have one which expects an Exception. See next.

=== Using a lambda which expects a checked exception.

We have a number of functional interfaces which work just like the built in classes of a similar name except they expect to throw a checked exception.

.Three of the FunctionalLambdas which can throw a Checked Exception
[source, Java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface ThrowingConsumer<I, T extends Throwable> {
    /**
     * Performs this operation on the given argument.
     *
     * @param in the input argument
     */
    void accept(I in) throws T;
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ThrowingFunction<I, R, T extends Throwable> {
    /**
     * Applies this function to the given argument.
     *
     * @param in the function argument
     * @return the function result
     */
    R apply(I in) throws T;
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ThrowingSupplier<V, T extends Throwable> {
    /**
     * Gets a result.
     *
     * @return a result
     */
    V get() throws T;
}
----

==== Using a ThrowingConsumer

In the following example, you can pass a consumer to `forEachChild` which can throw a checked exception
which is will thrown back to the caller.

.If the acceptor throws a checked Exception, the method throws the same Exception
[source, Java]
----
public <T extends Throwable> void forEachChild(@NotNull ThrowingConsumer<Asset, T> consumer) throws T {
    for (Asset child : children.values()) {
        consumer.accept(child);
    }
}
----

.onMessage can throw an InvalidSubscriberException which throw out of this method.
[source, Java]
----
void bootstrapTree(@NotNull Asset asset, @NotNull Subscriber<TopologicalEvent> subscriber) throws InvalidSubscriberException {
    asset.forEachChild(c -> {
        subscriber.onMessage(ExistingAssetEvent.of(asset.fullName(), c.name()));
        bootstrapTree(c, subscriber);
    });
}
----
