=== Service Interactions

There is a number of simple interactions a service can support.  Which pattern is best for your application can depend on what an existing application expects, and what latency requirements you have.  Broadly speaking these interactions fall into client-server and peir-to-peir messaginf.

=== Client-Server Messaging

Client-Server messaging is often synchronous, although asynchronous messaging is useful in reducing the cost of network latency.

==== Request/Response

The client sends a message to a server.  That message contains a message type to chose an action to perform on the server and usually includes a payload of data.  The response is usually just data.

For every message the client sends the server, it responses with a single message. Often the client waits for the response, however the client can process the response asynchronously to improve performance.

With asynchronous response processing, the client can send multiple requests over the same channel rather than wait for each one to complete.

.Synchronous server with synchronous client
[source,java]
----
interface OneRequestResponse {
    Response requestType(RequestData data);
}
----

.Synchronous server with asynchronous client
[source,java]
----
interface OneRequestResponse2 {
    void requestType(RequestData data, Consumer<Response> responseConsumer);
}
----

==== Request/Proxy

This is like request/response, except the object returned is a proxy for further access.  This is useful when the interface returned is a complex, or very large object.

This is used in Map returning a key set or values which is a proxy to the underlying map.

.Method on java.util.Map
[source,java]
----
public interface Map<K, V> {

    Set<K> keySet();
    
    Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> entrySet();
    
    Collection<V> values();
}
----

Using a proxy gives access to data without having to pass all the data from the server to the client.

==== Request/Callback

The client sends a message to a server.  That message contains information to call an action on the server and usually includes a payload of data.  The callback is also a message containing an action and data.

image::Request-Callback.jpg[]

The use of a callback provides a richer interaction between the caller and callee.

.Synchronous server with a callback
[source,java]
----
interface OneCallback {
    void resultOne(ResultOne result);

    void resultTwo(List<ResultOne> results);

    void errorResult(String message);
}

interface OneRequestCallback {
    void requestType(RequestData data, OneCallback callback);
}
----

The client can be configured to either wait for the server to call the callback, or handle the callback asynchronously.  The thread which performs the method in the callback will be on the client side.

==== Request/Visitor

The client sends one or two visitors to the server to apply to local objects or actors.  This visitor can be an update which applied atomically to an actor, and/or a vistor can be applied to retrieve specific information.

image::Request-Visitor.jpg[]

.Pass a function to apply on a server for a given key
[source,java]
----
interface KeyedResources<V> {

    void asyncUpdate(String key, Visitor<V> vistor);
    
    <R> R syncUpdate(String key, Visitor<V> updater, Function<V, R> returnFunction);
    
}
----

This approach allows the caller to apply an operation to an actor without needing to know where that actor is.


==== Request/Subscription

By requesting a subscription, a client can receive multiple asynchronous events.  This can start with a bootstrap of existing information, followed by live updates.

Once a subscription ahs been made, it should be altered, or cancelled

image::Request-Subscription.jpg[]

.Pass a function to apply on a server for a given key
[source,java]
----

interface Queryable<E> {

    <R> Subscription<E, R> subscribe(Filter<E> filter, Function<E, R> returnMapping, Subscriber<R> subscriber);
    
}

interface Subscription<R> {
    // change the current filter.
    void setFilter(Filter<E> newFilter);
    
    void cancel();
}
----

==== Client Injected Harness

This approach allows the client to version and configure which handlers are used on the server on the client's behalf. In particular, this is useful when supporting multiple versions of client concurrently.

image::Client-Injected-Handler.jpg[]

.Client passes a handler to intergate with the server and act it's behalf
[source,java]
----
interface AcceptsHandler {

    /**
     * The accept method takes a handler to pass to the server.
     * and it returns a proxy it can call to invoke that hdnler on the server.
     */
    <H extends ContextAcceptor> H accept(H handler);
}
----
